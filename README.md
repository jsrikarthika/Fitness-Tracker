# Fitness-Tracker

This Python program is a simple fitness tracker that allows users to log exercises, set fitness goals, and track their progress. Users can input exercise details (name, duration, intensity) and log them. The program also allows users to set goals, such as a target number of calories to burn, and tracks their progress towards those goals. The system calculates the total calories burned based on logged exercises and compares it with the user's set goals, displaying progress as a percentage. The program provides a menu for users to interact with and manage their fitness data.
